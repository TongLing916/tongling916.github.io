### Abstract

The great advantage of the affine camera is that, because of its linearity, many of the optimal algorithms can be implemented by linear algrebra.

### 14.1 Affine epipolar geometry

1. Because the cameras are affine their centres are at infinity, and there is parallel projection from scene to image.

2. All epipolar lines are parallel, as are the epipolar planes.

3. Since epipolar lines intersect in the epipole, and all epipolar lines are parallel, it follows that the epipole is at infinity.

### 14.2 The affine fundamental matrix

1. __Result 14.1.__ The fundamental matrix resulting from two cameras with the affine form (i.e. the third row is $$(0,0,0,1)$$) has the form $$F_A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & a\\
0 & 0 & b\\
c & d & e
\end{bmatrix} \quad \quad (14.1)$$.

### 14.3 Estimating $$F_A$$ from image point correspondences

#### 14.3.1 The linear algorithm

#### 14.3.2 The Gold Standard algorithm

#### 14.3.3 The minimal configuration

1. __Algorithm 14.2.__ The computation of $$F_A$$ for a minimal configuration of four point correspondences.

2. This minimal solution is useful in the case of robust estimation of algorithms, such as RANSAC.

3. Configurations for which $$F_A$$ cannot be computed are degenerate. These fall into two classes: first, degenerate configurations depending only on the structure, for example if the four points are coplanar (so there is no parallax), or if the first three points are collinear (so that $$H_A$$ can't be computed); second, those degeneracies which depend only on the cameras, for example if the two cameras have the same viewing direction (and so have common centres on the plane at infinity).

4. As relief reduces to zero, i.e. the point set approaches coplanarity, the covariance of the estimated $$F_A$$ will increase.

### 14.4 Triangulation

### 14.5 Affine reconstruction

### 14.6 Necker reversal and the bas-relief ambiguity

1. Even if the camera calibration is known, there remains a family of reconstruction ambiguities which cannot be resolved in the two-view case.

2. __Necker reversal ambiguity (a finite reflection ambiguity).__ This arises because an object rotating by $$\rho$$ and its mirror image rotating by $$- \rho$$ generate the same image under parallel projection.

3. __The bas-relief (depth-turn) ambiguity (a one-parameter family rotation ambiguity).__ This ambiguity casts light on the stability of reconstruction from two perspective cameras: as imaging conditions approach affine, the rotation angle will be poorly estimated, but the product of the rotation angle and depth will be stable.
