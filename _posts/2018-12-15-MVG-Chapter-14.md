### Abstract

The great advantage of the affine camera is that, because of its linearity, many of the optimal algorithms can be implemented by linear algrebra.

### 14.1 Affine epipolar geometry

1. Because the cameras are affine their centres are at infinity, and there is parallel projection from scene to image.

2. All epipolar lines are parallel, as are the epipolar planes.

3. Since epipolar lines intersect in the epipole, and all epipolar lines are parallel, it follows that the epipole is at infinity.

### 14.2 The affine fundamental matrix

1. __Result 14.1.__ The fundamental matrix resulting from two cameras with the affine form (i.e. the third row is $$(0,0,0,1)$$) has the form $$F_A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & a\\
0 & 0 & b\\
c & d & e
\end{bmatrix} \quad \quad (14.1)$$.
