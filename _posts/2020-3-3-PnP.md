### DLT[^Abdel1971]

#### Abstract

A method for photogrammetric data reduction without the necessity for neither fiducial marks nor initial approximations for inner and outer orientation parameters of the camera has been developed. This approach is particularly suitable for reduction of data from non-metric photography, but has also distinct advantages in its application to metric photography. Preliminary fictitious data tests indicate that the approach is promising. Experiments with real data are underway.

### P3P Fischler[^Fischler1981]

#### Abstract

A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Localization Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmarks solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.
