### [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

#### Question

There are two sorted arrays __nums1__ and __nums2__ of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

You may assume __nums1__ and __nums2__ cannot be both empty.

__Example 1:__
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

__Example 2:__
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

#### Train of Thought
