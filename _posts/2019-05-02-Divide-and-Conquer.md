### Summary

1.


### [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

#### Question

There are two sorted arrays __nums1__ and __nums2__ of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

You may assume __nums1__ and __nums2__ cannot be both empty.

__Example 1:__
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

__Example 2:__
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

### [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

#### Question

Find the <b>k</b>th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```

__Note:__

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

### [241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/)

#### Question

Given a string of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. The valid operators are `+`, `-` and `*`.
__Example 1:__
```
Input: "2-1-1"
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation:
((2-1)-1) = 0
(2-(1-1)) = 2
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: "2*3-4*5"
Output: [-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]
Explanation:
(2*(3-(4*5))) = -34
((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14
((2*(3-4))*5) = -10
(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10
(((2*3)-4)*5) = 10
```
