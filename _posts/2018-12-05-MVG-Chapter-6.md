### Abstract

This chapter describes the projection of 3D scene space onto a 2D image plane. There are two particularly important classes of camera matrix: finite cameras, and cameras with their centre at infinity such as the _affine camera_ which represents parallel projection.

### 6.1 Finite cameras

1.

### 6.2 The projective camera

1.

#### 6.2.1 Camera anatomy

1. In the case of error in both images, the ressidual error is $$\epsilon _{res} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4n}}( \sum_{i=1}^{n} d(x_i, \hat{x_i})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} d(x_i^\prime, \hat{x_i}^\prime)^2)^{1/2} \quad \quad (5.2)$$.

#### 6.2.2 Action of a projective camera on points

1.

#### 6.2.3. Depth of points

1.

#### 6.2.4 Decomposition of the camera matrix

1.

#### 6.2.5. Euclidean vs projective spaces

1.

### 6.3 Cameras at infinity

1.

#### 6.3.1 Affine cameras

1.

#### 6.3.2 Error in employing an affine camera

1.

#### 6.3.3 Decomposition of $$P_{\infty}$$

1.

#### 6.3.4 A hierarchy of affine camera

1.

#### 6.3.5 More properties of the affine camera

1.

#### 6.3.6 General cameras at infinity

1.

### 6.4 Other camera models

#### 6.4.1 Pushbroom Cameras

#### 6.4.2 Line cameras

### 6.5 Closure
