### [51\. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

Difficulty: **Hard**


The _n_-queens puzzle is the problem of placing _n_ queens on an _n_×_n_ chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/8-queens.png)

Given an integer _n_, return all distinct solutions to the _n_-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the _n_-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
```


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

### [52\. N-Queens II](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/)

Difficulty: **Hard**


The _n_-queens puzzle is the problem of placing _n_ queens on an _n_×_n_ chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/8-queens.png)

Given an integer _n_, return the number of distinct solutions to the _n_-queens puzzle.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int totalNQueens(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

### [1001\. Grid Illumination](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination/)

Difficulty: **Hard**


On a `N x N` grid of cells, each cell `(x, y)` with `0 <= x < N` and `0 <= y < N` has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.  `lamps[i]` tells us the location of the `i`-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query `queries[i] = (x, y)`, the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query `(x, y)` [in the order given by `queries`], we turn off any lamps that are at cell `(x, y)` or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell `(x, y)`.)

Return an array of answers.  Each value `answer[i]` should be equal to the answer of the `i`-th query `queries[i]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation:
Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= N <= 10^9`
2.  `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
3.  `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
4.  `lamps[i].length == queries[i].length == 2`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> gridIllumination(int N, vector<vector<int>>& lamps, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        
    }
};
```
