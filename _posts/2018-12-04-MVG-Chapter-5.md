### Abstract

This chapter describes methods for assessing and quatifying the results of estimation algorithms. Often it is not sufficient to simply have an estimate of a variable or transformation. Instead some measure of confidence or uncertainty is also requried.

Two methods for computing this uncertainty (covariance) are outlined here. The first is based on linear approximations and involves concatenating various Jacobian expressions. The sencond is the easier to implement Monte Carlo method.
