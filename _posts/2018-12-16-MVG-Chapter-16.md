### Abstract

This chapter describes numerical methods for estimating the trifocal tensor given a set of point and line correspondences across three views. Five methods will be discussed:
- A linear method based on direct solution of a set of linear equations (after appropriate data normalization).
- An iterative method, that minimizes the algebraic error, while satisfying all appropriate constraints on the tensor.
- An iterative method that minimizes geometric error (the "Gold Standard" method).
- An iterative method that minimizes the Sampson approximation to geometric error.
- Robust estimation based on RANSAC.

### 16.1 Basic equations

#### 16.1.1 The internal constraints

1. __Definition 16.1.__ A trifocal tensor $$\mathcal{T}_i^{jk}$$ is said to be "geometrically valid" or "satisfy all internal constraints" if there exist three camera matrices $$P = [I \; \;0], P^\prime$$ and $$P^{\prime \prime}$$ such that $$\mathcal{T}_i^{jk}$$ corresponds to the three camera matrices according to $$\mathcal{T}_i^{jk}=a_i^jb_4^k-a_4^jb_i^k$$.

#### 16.1.2 The minimum case - 6 point correspondences

### 16.2 The normalized linear algorithm

#### How to represent lines

#### Normalization

1. __Algorithm 16.1.__ The normalized linear algorithm for computation of $$\mathcal{T}$$.

2. This algorithm does not consider the constraints discussed in section 16.1.1. These constraints ought to be enforced before the denormalization step (final stel).

### 16.3 The algebraic minimization algorithm

1. Our task will be to compute a geometrically valid trifocal tensor $$\mathcal{T}_i^{jk}$$ from a set of image correspondences.

#### Retrieving the epipoles

#### Algebraic minimization

#### Iterative method

1. __Algorithm 16.2.__ Computing the trifocal tensor minimizing algebraic error. The computation should be carried out on data normalized in the manner of algorithm 16.1. Normalization and denormalization steps are omitted here for simplicity. This algorithm finds the geometrically valid trifocal tensor that minimizes algebraic error. At the cost of a slightly inferior solution, the last iteration step may be omitted, providing a fast non-iterative algorithm.

### 16.4 Geometric distance

#### 16.4.1 The Gold Standard method for the trifocal tensor

1. __Algorithm 16.3.__ The Gold Standard algorithm for estimating $$\mathcal{T}$$ from image correspondences.

2. The technique can be extended to include line correspondences.

#### 16.4.2 Parametrization of the trifocal tensor

1. A parametrization which ensures that the tensor does satisfy its constraintsm, and so is geometrically valid, is termed _consistent._

#### 16.4.3 First-order geometric error (Sampson distance)

1. The trifocal tensor may be computed using a geometric cost function based on the Sampson approximation in a manner entirely analogous to the Sampson method used to compute the fundamental matrix.

2. The Sampson error method has various advantages:
  - It gives a good approximation to actual geometric error (the optimum), using a relatively simple iterative algorithm.
  - As in the case of actual geomtric error, non-isotropic and unequal error distributions may be specified for each of the points without significantly complicating the algorithm.

### 16.5 Experimental evaluation of the algorithms

#### 16.5.1 Results and recommendations

### 16.6 Automatic computation of $$\mathcal{T}$$

1. This section describes an algorithm to compute the trifocal geometry between three images automatically. The input to the algorithm is simply the triplet of images, with no other _a priori_ information required; and the output is the estimated trifocal tensor together with a set of interest points in correspondence across the three images.

2. There are fewer mismatches over three views than there are over two.

3. __Algorithm 16.4.__ Algorithm to automatically estimate the trifocal tensor over three images using RANSAC.

4. __The distance measure - reprojection error.__

### 16.7 Special cases of $$\mathcal{T}$$-computation

#### 16.7.1 Computing $$\mathcal{T}^{jk}_i$$ from a plane plus parallax

#### 16.7.2 Lines specified by several points  

1. __Orthogonal regression.__ The line $$l$$ that minimizes the sum of squared distances to the set of all points $$x_i=(x_i,y_i,1)^T$$ is obtained as follows.
  1. Define matries $$E=\sum _ i x_ i x_ i^T$$ and $$J=diag(1,1,0)$$.
  2. Let $$\xi _ 0$$ be the minimum root of the equation $$det(E-\xi J)=0$$.
  3. The required line $$l$$ is the right null-vector of the matrix $$E-\xi _ 0J$$.

2. This gives a least-squares best fit of a line to a set of points. This process is known as _orthogonal regression_ and it extends in an obvious way to higher-dimensional fitting of a hyperplane to a set of points in a way that minimizes the sum of squared distances to the point.
