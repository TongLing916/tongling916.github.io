### [55\. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
#include <algorithm>

#include <iostream>

#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// find if the last step which can arrive n - 1 is the first index
class Solution1 {
public:
	bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
		ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
		cin.tie(0);
		int n = nums.size();
		int lastJump = n - 1;
		for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
			if (i + nums[i] >= lastJump)
				lastJump = i;

		return (lastJump == 0) ? true : false;

	}
};

// check how far we can get from the first index
class Solution2 {
public:
	bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
		int n = nums.size();
		if (n == 0) return true;
		int start = 1;
		int end = nums[0];
		while (start <= end && end < n)
		{
			int max_end = 0;
			for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i)
				max_end = std::max(max_end, i + nums[i]);
			start = end + 1;
			end = max_end;
		}
		if (end >= n - 1) return true;
		return false;
	}
};

int main()
{
	vector<int> test1{ 3,2,1,0,4 };
	vector<int> test2{ 2,3,1,1,4 };
	Solution1 solution;
	cout << solution.canJump(test1) << endl;
	cout << solution.canJump(test2) << endl;
}

### [134\. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


There are _N_ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station _i_ is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station _i_ to its next station (_i_+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

*   If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
*   Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
*   Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4\. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0\. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1\. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2\. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3\. The cost is 5\. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0\. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1\. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

#### Train of Thought

1. 如果从A出发只能到H，那么从A与H间任意一点出发，我们也只能到H。

2. 如果总的gas比总的cost要多，那么一定存在一个解。


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
#include <vector>

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
	int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
		int n = gas.size();
		int gas_left = 0;
		int start = 0;
		int cur_left = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
		{
			cur_left += gas[i] - cost[i];
			gas_left += gas[i] - cost[i];
			if (cur_left < 0)
			{
				start = i + 1;
				cur_left = 0;
			}
		}
		return gas_left < 0 ? -1 : start;
	}
};

int main()
{
	vector<int> gas{ 2,3,4 };
	vector<int> cost{ 3,4,3 };
	Solution solution;
	cout << solution.canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) << endl;
}

### [376\. Wiggle Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

**Follow up:**  
Can you do it in O(_n_) time?


#### Train of Thought

首先，如果只有0个或1个元素的话，我们就不需要验证了。

如果有2个元素，我们可以通过验证这两个元素是否相等，然后再决定返回值。

如果有2个以上元素，我们可以遍历一遍列表，判断difference的正负号变了多少次（如果是0的话，那就忽略。但是数组开头的0需要谨慎对待）。

例子：`1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8`。两两相减，其中差为`16, -12, 5, 3, 2, -5, -5, 11, -8`。缩减过后，我们得到`16, -12, 10, -10, 11, -8`。一共6个difference，所以一共7个数。


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
#include <vector>

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
	int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
		int n = nums.size();
		if (n <= 1) return n;

			else return 1;

		int last_diff = nums[1] - nums[0];
		int cnt = (last_diff != 0) ? 1 : 0; // count the number of differences
		for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)
		{
			int cur_diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
			if (cur_diff == 0) continue;
			if ((cur_diff > 0 && last_diff <= 0) || (cur_diff < 0 && last_diff >= 0))
			{
				++cnt;
				last_diff = cur_diff;
			}
		}
		return cnt + 1;
	}

### [402\. Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a non-negative integer _num_ represented as a string, remove _k_ digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

**Note:**  

*   The length of _num_ is less than 10002 and will be ≥ _k_.
*   The given _num_ does not contain any leading zero.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200\. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

### [435\. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Note:**

1.  You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2.  Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

### [621\. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

**Example:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

**Note:**

1.  The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2.  The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

### [714\. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Your are given an array of integers `prices`, for which the `i`-th element is the price of a given stock on day `i`; and a non-negative integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

**Note:**

*   `0 < prices.length <= 50000`.*   `0 < prices[i] < 50000`.*   `0 <= fee < 50000`.

#### Solution

Language: **C++**

### [763\. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


A string `S` of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

**Note:**  

1.  `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
2.  `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        
    }
};
```



### [767\. Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a string `S`, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.

If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "aab"
Output: "aba"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "aaab"
Output: ""
```

**Note:**

*   `S` will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range `[1, 500]`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string reorganizeString(string S) {
        
    }
};
```



### [842\. Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-fibonacci-sequence/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a string `S` of digits, such as `S = "123456579"`, we can split it into a _Fibonacci-like sequence_ `[123, 456, 579].`

Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list `F` of non-negative integers such that:

*   `0 <= F[i] <= 2^31 - 1`, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type);
*   `F.length >= 3`;
*   and `F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2]` for all `0 <= i < F.length - 2`.

Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from `S`, or return `[]` if it cannot be done.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "123456579"
Output: [123,456,579]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "11235813"
Output: [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "112358130"
Output: []
Explanation: The task is impossible.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "0123"
Output: []
Explanation: Leading zeroes are not allowed, so "01", "2", "3" is not valid.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "1101111"
Output: [110, 1, 111]
Explanation: The output [11, 0, 11, 11] would also be accepted.
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= S.length <= 200`
2.  `S` contains only digits.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> splitIntoFibonacci(string S) {
        
    }
};
```


### [861\. Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


We have a two dimensional matrix `A` where each value is `0` or `1`.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation:
Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= A.length <= 20`
2.  `1 <= A[0].length <= 20`
3.  `A[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int matrixScore(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        
    }
};
```


### [870\. Advantage Shuffle](https://leetcode.com/problems/advantage-shuffle/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given two arrays `A` and `B` of equal size, the _advantage of `A` with respect to `B`_ is the number of indices `i` for which `A[i] > B[i]`.

### [921\. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a string `S` of `'('` and `')'` parentheses, we add the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, and in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

*   It is the empty string, or
*   It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
*   It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

Given a parentheses string, return the minimum number of parentheses we must add to make the resulting string valid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "())"
Output: 1
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: "((("
Output: 3
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: "()"
Output: 0
```


**Example 4:**

```
Input: "()))(("
Output: 4
```


**Note:**

1.  `S.length <= 1000`
2.  `S` only consists of `'('` and `')'` characters.


#### Solution

### [948\. Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


You have an initial power `P`, an initial score of `0` points, and a bag of tokens.

Each token can be used at most once, has a value `token[i]`, and has potentially two ways to use it.

*   If we have at least `token[i]` power, we may play the token face up, losing `token[i]` power, and gaining `1` point.
*   If we have at least `1` point, we may play the token face down, gaining `token[i]` power, and losing `1` point.

Return the largest number of points we can have after playing any number of tokens.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = [100], P = 50
Output: 0
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = [100,200], P = 150
Output: 1
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2
```

**Note:**

1.  `tokens.length <= 1000`
2.  `0 <= tokens[i] < 10000`
3.  `0 <= P < 10000`

### [955\. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


We are given an array `A` of `N` lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.

Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.

For example, if we have an array `A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef","vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `D` such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in **lexicographic** order (`A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2] ... <= A[A.length - 1]`).

Return the minimum possible value of `D.length`.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["ca","bb","ac"]
Output: 1
Explanation:
After deleting the first column, A = ["a", "b", "c"].
Now A is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2]).
We require at least 1 deletion since initially A was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["xc","yb","za"]
Output: 0
Explanation:
A is already in lexicographic order, so we don't need to delete anything.
Note that the rows of A are not necessarily in lexicographic order:
ie. it is NOT necessarily true that (A[0][0] <= A[0][1] <= ...)
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
Output: 3
Explanation:
We have to delete every column.
```


**Note:**

1.  `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2.  `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& A) {
        
    }
};
```


### [984\. String Without AAA or BBB](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-without-aaa-or-bbb/)

*   The substring `'aaa'` does not occur in `S`;
*   The substring `'bbb'` does not occur in `S`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = 1, B = 2
Output: "abb"
Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = 4, B = 1
Output: "aabaa"
```


**Note:**

1.  `0 <= A <= 100`
2.  `0 <= B <= 100`
3.  It is guaranteed such an `S` exists for the given `A` and `B`.


#### Solution

### [991\. Broken Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/broken-calculator/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:

*   **Double**: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
*   **Decrement**: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.

Initially, the calculator is displaying the number `X`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number `Y`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: X = 2, Y = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: X = 5, Y = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: X = 3, Y = 10
Output: 3
Explanation:  Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: X = 1024, Y = 1
Output: 1023
Explanation: Use decrement operations 1023 times.
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= X <= 10^9`
2.  `1 <= Y <= 10^9`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

### [1007\. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


In a row of dominoes, `A[i]` and `B[i]` represent the top and bottom halves of the `i`-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the `i`-th domino, so that `A[i]` and `B[i]` swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in `A` are the same, or all the values in `B` are the same.

If it cannot be done, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/08/domino.png)

```
Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation:
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6`
2.  `2 <= A.length == B.length <= 20000`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDominoRotations(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        
    }
};
```
