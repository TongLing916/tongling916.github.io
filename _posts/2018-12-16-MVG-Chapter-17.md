### Abstract

It is shown that multiple view relations may be derived directly and uniformly from the intersection properties of back-projected lines and points.

We also develop general counting arguments for the degrees of freedom of the tensors and the number of point and line correspondences required for tensor computation.

### 17.1 Bilinear relations

#### 17.1.1 Epipoles as tensors

#### 17.1.2 Affine specialization

### 17.2 Trilinear relations

#### 17.2.1 Trifocal point relations

#### 17.2.2 Trifocal line relations

#### 17.2.3 Relations between two views and the trifocal tensor

#### 17.2.4 Affine trifocal tensor

### 17.3 Quadrilinear relations

### 17.4 Intersections of four planes

### 17.5 Counting arguments

1. Generally for $$m$$ cameras, we have $$# dof = 11m - 15$$.

2. The required number of points is $$n\geq \frac{11m-15}{2m-3}=5+\frac{m}{2m-3}$$.

3. The required number of lines is $$l\geq \frac{11m-15}{2m-4}$$.

4. __Table 17.3.__ Projective degrees of freedom and constraints. The linear column indicates the minimum number of correspondences across all views required to solve linearly for the tensor (up to scale). The non-linear is the minimum number of correspondences required. A star indicates multiple solutions, a question-mark indicates that no practical reconstruction method is known.

#### 17.5.1 Affine cameras

1. For affine cameras, the plane at infinity may be identified in a reconstruction, being the principal plane of all of the cameras, and the reconstruction ambiguity is affine.

2. The number of degrees of freedom for $$m$$ affien camera is $$# dof = 8m - 12$$.

3. The required number of points is $$n\geq \frac{8m-12}{2m-3}=4$$.

4. The required number of lines is $$l\geq \frac{8m-12}{2m-4}=4+\frac{2}{m-2}$$.

5. __Table 17.4.__ Affine degrees of freedom and constraints. The camera for each view is affine.

#### 17.5.2 Knowing four coplanar points - plane plus parallax

1. __Table 17.5.__ Number of additional correspondences required to compute projective structure given 2D homographies between the views, induced by a plane. The homographies may be computed from four or more point matches derived from coplanar points, or by any other means. Points used to compute the homographies are not counted in this table.

2. Each line correspondences across $$m$$ views generates $$m-2$$ constraints on the remaining degrees of freedom of the cameras.

3. Two point correspondences across $$m$$ views generate $$3m-4$$ constraints on the remaining degrees of freedom of the cameras.
