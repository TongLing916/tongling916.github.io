### Abstract

It is shown that multiple view relations may be derived directly and uniformly from the intersection properties of back-projected lines and points.

We also develop general counting arguments for the degrees of freedom of the tensors and the number of point and line correspondences required for tensor computation.

### 17.1 Bilinear relations

#### 17.1.1 Epipoles as tensors

#### 17.1.2 Affine specialization

### 17.2 Trilinear relations

#### 17.2.1 Trifocal point relations

#### 17.2.2 Trifocal line relations

#### 17.2.3 Relations between two views and the trifocal tensor

#### 17.2.4 Affine trifocal tensor

### 17.3 Quadrilinear relations

### 17.4 Intersections of four planes

### 17.5 Counting arguments

1. Generally for $$m$$ cameras, we have $$# dof = 11m - 15$$.

2. The required number of points is $$n\geq \frac{11m-15}{2m-3}=5+\frac{m}{2m-3}$$.

3. The required number of lines is $$l\geq \frac{11m-15}{2m-4}$$.

4. __Table 17.3.__ Projective degrees of freedom and constraints. The linear column indicates the minimum number of correspondences across all views required to solve linearly for the tensor (up to scale). The non-linear is the minimum number of correspondences required. A star indicates multiple solutions, a question-mark indicates that no practical reconstruction method is known.
