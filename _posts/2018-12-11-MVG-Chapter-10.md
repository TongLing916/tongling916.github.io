### Abstract

This chapter describes how and to what extent the spatial layout of a scene and the cameras can be recovered from two view.

Suppose that a set of image correspondences $$x_i \leftrightarrow x_i^\prime$$ are given. It is assumed that these correspondences come from a set of 3D points $$X_i$$, which are unknown. Similarly, the position, orientation and calibration of the cameras are not known. The reconstruction task if to find the camera matrices $$P$$ and $$P^\prime$$, as well as the 3D points $$X_i$$ such that $$x_i = PX_i \quad x_i^\prime = P^\prime X_i \quad \quad for all i$$.

Given too few points, this task is not possible. However, if there are sufficiently many point correspondences to allow the fundamental matrix to be computed uniquely, then the scene may be reconstructed up to a projective ambiguity.

### 10.1 Outline of reconstruction method

1. We describe a method for reconstruction from two views as follows.
  1) Compute the fundamental matrix from point correspondences.
  2) Compute the camera matrices from the fundamental matrix.
  3) For each point correspondence $$x_i \leftrightarrow x_i^\prime$$, compute the point in space that projects to these two image points.

2. For step 3), we use __triangulation__. The image points $$x$$ and $$x^\prime$$ back project to rays. If the epipolar constraint $$x^\prime Fx=0$$ is satisfied, then these two rays lie in a plane, and so intersect in a point $$X$$ in 3-space.

3. The only points in 3-space that cannot be determined from their images are points on the baseline between the two cameras. Points on the baseline project to the epipole in both images.

### 10.2 Reconstruction ambiguity

1. For calibrated camera, reconstruction is possible _up to a similarity transformation_ (rotation, translation and scaling) (_metric reconstruction_, or _Euclidean reconstruction_).

2. Reconstruction from uncalibrated cameras is possible _up to a projective transformation_.

### 10.3 The projective reconstruction theorem

### 10.4 Stratified reconstruction

1. The "stratified" approach to reconstruction is to begin with a projective reconstruction and then to refine it progressively to an affine and finally a metric reconstruction, if possible.

#### 10.4.1 The step to affine reconstruction

1. The essence to affine reconstruction is to locate the plane at infinity by some means, since this knowledge is equivalent to affine reconstruction.

2. The plane at infinity cannot be identified unless some extra information that suffices for this identification.

3. __Translational motion.__ __Result 10.2.__ Suppose the motion of the camera is a pure translation with no rotation and no change in the internal parameters. As shown in exmaple 9.6 (p249) $$F = \left [ e \right ]_ \times = \left [ e^\prime \right ]_ \times$$, and for an affine reconstruction, one may choose the two cameras as $$P = \left [ I \quad 0 \right ]$$ and $$P^\prime = \left [ I \quad e^\prime \right ]$$.

3. __Scene constraints.__ 1) Parallel lines. 2) Distance ratios on a line.

4. __The infinite homography.__

5. __One of the camera is affine.__

#### 10.4.2 The step to metric reconstruction

1. As the key to affine reconstruction is the identification of the plane at infinity, the key to metric reconstruction is the identification of the absolute conic.

2. This approach to metric reconstruction relies on identifying the image of the absolute conic. Three sources of constraint on the image of the absolute conic are given, and in practice a combination of these constraints is used.
  1) Constraints arising from scene orthogonality.
  2) Constraints arising from known internal parameters.
  3) Constraints arising from the same cameras in all images.

#### 10.4.3 Direct metric reconstruction using $$\omega$$

1. Knowing $$\omega$$, it is possible to proceed directly to metric reconstruction, given at least two views.

2. The most evident approach is to use the IAC to compute calibration of each of the cameras, and then carray out a calibrated reconstruction.

3. A more conceptual approach to metric reconstruction is to use knowledge of the IAC to directly determine the plane at infinity and the absolute conic.

### 10.5 Direct reconstruction - using ground truth

1. It is possible to jump directly from a projective reconstruction to a metric reconstruction if "ground control points" (that is points with known 3D locations in a Euclidean world frame) are given.

### 10.6 Closure

1. An overview of the steps necessary to produce a metric reconstruction from a pair of images.
