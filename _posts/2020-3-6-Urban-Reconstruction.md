### Multi-view Superpixel Stereo in Man-made Environments [^Micusik08]

#### Abstract

Man-made environments possess many regularities which can be efficiently exploited for 3D dense reconstruction from multiple widely separated views. We present an approach utilizing properties of piecewise planarity and restricted number of plane orientations to suppress the ambiguities causing failures of standard dense stereo methods. We formulate the problem of the 3D reconstruction in _Markov Random Field_ (MRF) framework built on an image presegmented into superpixels. Using this representation, we propose novel robust cost measures, which overcome many difficulties of standard pixel-based formulations and handles favorably problematic scenarios containing many repetitive structures and no or low textured regions. We demonstrate our approach on several low textured, wide-baseline scenes demonstrating superior performance compared to previously proposed methods.
