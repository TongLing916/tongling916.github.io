### Abstract

When a projective reconstruction of a scene is carried out from a set of point correspondences, an important piece of information is typically ignored - if the points are visible in the images, then they must have been in front of the camera.

### 21.1 Quasi-affine transformations

### 21.2 Front and back of a camera

### 21.3 Three-dimensional point sets

### 21.4 Obtaining a quasi-affine reconstruction

### 21.5 Effect of transformations on cheirality

### 21.6 Orientation

### 21.7 The cheiral inequalities

#### Solving the cheiral inequalities

#### Summary of the algorithm
