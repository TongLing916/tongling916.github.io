### Abstract

This chapter descirbes how to compute the position of a point in 3-space given its image in two views and the camera matrices of those views. It is assumed that there are errors only in the measured image coordinates, not in the projection matrices $$P, P^\prime$$.

It is desirable to find a triangulation method that is invariant to projective transformations of space.

Note, this is the scenario where $$F$$ is given _a priori_ and then $$X$$ is determined.

### 12.1 Problem statement

1. It is supposed that the camera matrices, and hence the fundamental matrix, are provided.

2. The key idea of the projective-invariant triangulation method is to estimate a 3D $$\hat{X}$$ which exactly satisfies the supplied camera geometry, so it projects as $$\hat{x}=P\hat{X} \; \; \hat{x}^\prime=P^\prime\hat{X}$$ and the aim is to estimate $$\hat{X}$$ from the image measurements $$x$$ and $$x^\prime$$. The maximum likelihood estimate, under Gaussian noise, is given by the point $$\hat{X}$$ which minimizes the reprojection error.

### 12.2 Linear triangulation methods

1. __Homogeneous method (DLT).__

2. __Inhomogeneous method.__ Use the least-squares solution to these inhomogeneous equations. However, difficulties arise if the true solution $$X$$ has last coordinate equal or close to 0. In this case, it is not legitimate to set it to 1 and instabilities can occur.

3. These methods have quite different properties in the presence of noise. The inhomogeneous method assumes that the solution point $$X$$ is not at infinity. Furthermore, these two methods are not projective-invariant.

3. Nevertheless, the homogeneous linear method often provides acceptable results. Furthermore, it has the virtue that it generalizes easily to triangulation when more than two views of the point are available.

### 12.3 Geometric error cost function

1. We seek the points $$\hat{x}$$ and $$\hat{x}^\prime$$ that minimizes the function $$\mathcal{C}(x,x^\prime) = d(x,\hat{x})^2 + d(x^\prime, \hat{x}^\prime)^2 \quad subject \; to \; \hat{x}^\prime F\hat{x}=0 \quad (12.1) $$, where $$d(*,*)$$ is the Euclidean distance between the points.

2. Assuming a Gaussian error distribution, the points $$\hat{x}^\prime$$ and $$\hat{x}$$ are Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) for the true image point correspondences.

### 12.4 Sampson approximation (first-order geometric correction)

1. The Sampson approximation is valid when the measurement errors are small compared with the measurements.

2. The corrected points will _not_ satisfy the epipolar relation $$\hat{x}^\prime F \hat{x} = 0$$ exactly.

### 12.5 An optimal solution

1. We descirbe a method of triangulation that finds the global minimum of the cost function (12.1) using a non-iterative algorithm. if the Gaussian noise model can be assumed to be correct, this triangulation method is then provably optimal.  

#### 12.5.1 Reformulation of the minimization problem

#### 12.5.2 Details of the minimization

1. If both of the image points correspond with the epipoles, then the point in space lies on the line joining the camera centres. In this case, it is impossible to determine the position of the point in space.

2. If only one of the corresponding points lies at an epipole, then we conclude that the point in space must coincide with the other camera centre.

#### 12.5.3 Local minima

1. Even in the case of perfect matches, local minima may occur.

#### 12.5.4 Evaluation on real images

### 12.6 Probability distribution of the estimated 3D point

1. __Uncertainty of reconstruction.__ The uncertainty region depends on the angle between the rays. Points are less precisely localized along the ray as the rays become more parallel. Forward motion in particular can give poor reconstructions since rays are almost parallel for much of the field of view.

2. A good rule of thumb is that the angle between the rays determines the accuracy of reconstruction.
