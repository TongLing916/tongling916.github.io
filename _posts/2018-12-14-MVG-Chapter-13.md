### Abstract

This chapter describes the projective geometry of two cameras and a world plane.

There are two relations between the two views: first, through the epipolar geometry, a point in one view determines a line in the other which is the image of the ray through the point; and second, through the homography, a point in one view determines a point in the other which is the image of the intersection of the ray with the plane.

Two other important notions: the parallax with respect to a plane, and the infinite homography.

### 13.1 Homographies given the plane and vice versa

1. In general position, the homography is determined uniquely by the plane and vice versa. General position in this case means that the plane does not contain either of the camera centres. If the plane does contain one of the camera centre, then the induced homography is degenerate.

2. __Result 13.1.__ Given the projection matrices for the two views $$P=[I \quad 0] \quad \quad P^\prime=[A \quad a]$$ and a plane defined by $$\pi ^T X = 0$$ with $$\pi = (v^T,1)^T$$, then the homography induced by the plane is $$x^\prime=Hx$$ with $$H=A-av^T \quad \quad (13.1)$$.

#### 13.1.1 Homographies compatible with epipolar geometry

1. A homography $$H$$ is compatible with a fundamental matrix $$F$$ if and only if the matrix $$H^T F$$ is skew-symmetric: $$H^T F + F^T H= 0 \quad \quad (13.3)$$.

2. __Result 13.3.__ Given the fundamental matrix $$F$$ between two views, the three-parameter family of homographies induced by a world plane is $$H=A-e^\prime v^T \quad \quad (13.4)$$, where $$\left [ e^\prime \right ]_ \times A = F$$ is any decomposition of the fundamental matrix.

### 13.2 Plane induced homographies given $$F$$ and image correspondences

1. The corresponding image entities have to satisfy _consistency constraints_ with the epipolar geometry.

2. There are _degenerate configurations_ of the 3D elements and cameras for which the homography is not defined. Such degeneracies arise from collinearities and coplanarities of the 3D elements and the epipolar geometry. There may also be degeneracies of the solution method, but these can be avoided.

#### 13.2.1 Three points  

1. __Result 13.6.__ Given $$F$$ and the three image point correspondences $$x_i \leftrightarrow x_i^\prime$$, the homography induced by the plane of the 3D points is $$H=A-e\prime (M^{-1}b)^T$$, where $$A=\left [ e^\prime \right ]_ \times F$$ and $$b$$ is a 3-vector with components $$b_i = \frac{(x_i^\prime \times (Ax_i))^T (x_i^\prime \times e^\prime)}{(x_i^\prime \times e^\prime)^T(x_i^\prime \times e^\prime)} = x_i^T v \quad \quad (13.6)$$ and $$M$$ is a $$3 \times 3$$ matrix with rows $$x_i^T$$.

2. A solution cannot be obtained if $$M^T$$ is not of full rank. Algebraically, $$det \; M = 0$$ if the three image points $$x_i$$ are collinear. Geometrically, three collinear image points arise from collinear world points, or coplanar world points where the plane contains the first camera centre.

3. The equation $$e^\prime \times x_i^\prime = Fx_i$$ is a _consistency constraint_ between $$x_i$$ and $$x_i^\prime$$, since it is independent of $$v$$.

4. __Algorithm 13.1.__ The optimal of the homography induced by a plane defined by three points.

#### 13.2.2 A point and line

1. __Result 13.7.__ The homography for the pencil of planes defined by a line correspondence $$$$ is given by $$H(\mu )=\left [ l^\prime \right ]_ \times F + \mu e^\prime l^T \quad \quad (13.7)$$, provided $$l^{\prime T}e^\prime \neq = 0$$, where $$\mu$$ is a projective parameter.

2. __Result 13.8.__ Given $$F$$ and a corresponding point $$x\leftrightarrow x^\prime$$ and line $$l\leftrightarrow l^\prime$$, the homography induced by the plane of the 3-space point and line is $$H=\left [ l^\prime \right ]_ \times F + \frac{(x^\prime \times e^\prime)^T (x^\prime \times ((Fx) \times l^\prime))}{\left \| x^\prime \times e^\prime \right \|^2 (l^T x)}e^\prime l^T$$.

3. __Degenerate homographies.__ The degenerate (singular) homographies in (13.7) are at $$\mu = \infty$$ and $$\mu = 0$$. These correpond to planes through the first and second camera centres respectively.


### 13.3 Computing $$F$$ given the homography induced by a plane

1. __Plane induced parallax.__ The homography induced by a plane generates a virtual parallax. $$F$$ can be computed uniquely from the image of six points, four of which are coplanar and two are off the plane. The six-point result is quite surprising since for seven points in general position, there are 3 solutions for $$F$$ (see section 11.1.2).  

2. __Algorithm 13.2.__ Computing $$F$$ given the correspondences of six points of which four are coplanar.

3. __Projective depth.__ A world point $$X=(x^T, \rho)^T$$ is imaged at $$x$$ in the first view and at $$x^\prime = Hx + \rho e^\prime \quad \quad (13.9)$$ in the second. Note that $$x^\prime, e^\prime$$ and $$Hx$$ are collinear. The scalar $$\rho$$ is the parallax _relative_ to the homography $$H$$, and may be interpreted as a "depth" relative to the plane $$\pi$$.

### 13.4 The infinite homography $$H_\infty$$

1. __Definition 13.10.__ The infinite homography, $$H_\infty$$, is the homography induced by the plane at infinity, $$\pi_\infty$$.

2. $$H_\infty$$ is the homography that relates image points of _any_ depth if the camera rotates about its centre.
