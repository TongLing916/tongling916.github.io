### Abstract

This chapter describes numerical methods for estimating the fundamental matrix given a set of point correspondences between two images and covers a method image rectification based on the computed $$F$$.

### 11.1 Basic equations

1. From the equation $$x^{\prime T}Fx = 0 \quad \quad (11.1)$$, we can obtain a set of linear equations of the form $$Af = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1^\prime x_1 & x_1^\prime y_1 & x_1^\prime & y_1^\prime x_1 & y_1^\prime y_1 & y_1^\prime & x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
x_n^\prime x_n & x_n^\prime y_n & x_n^\prime & y_n^\prime x_n & y_n^\prime y_n & y_n^\prime & x_n & y_n & 1
\end{bmatrix} f = 0 \quad \quad (11.3)$$, where f is the 9-vector made up of the entries of $$F$$ in row-major order.

2. This is homogeneous set of equations, and $$f$$ can only be determined up to scale. For a solution to  exist, matrix $$A$$ must have rank at most 8. If the data is not exact, because of noise in the point coordinates, then the rank of $$A$$ may be greater than 8. In this case, one finds a least-squares solution.

#### 11.1 The singularity constraint

1. An important property of th fundamental matrix is that it is singular, in fact of rank 2. The matrix $$F$$ found by solving the set of linear equations (11.3) will not in general have rank 2, and we should take steps to enforce this constraint. The most convenient way to do this is to correct the matrix $$F$$ found by the SVD solution from $$A$$.

3. The 8-point algorithm for computation of the fundamental matrix: 1) __Linear solution.__ A solution $$F$$ is obtained from the vector $$f$$ corresponding to the smalles singular value of $$A$$, where $$A$$ is defined in (11.3). 2) __Constraint enforcement.__ Replace $$F$$ by $$F^\prime$$, the closest singular matrix to $$F$$ under a Frobenius norm. This correction is done using the SVD.

### 11.2 The normalized 8-point algorithm

1. The key to success with the 8-point algorithm is proper careful normalization of the input data before constructing the equations to solve. The suggested normalization is a translation and scaling of each image so that the centroid of the reference points is at the origin of the coordinates and the RMS distance of the points from the origin is equal to $$\sqrt{2}$$. This is carried out for essentially the same reasons as in chapter 4.
