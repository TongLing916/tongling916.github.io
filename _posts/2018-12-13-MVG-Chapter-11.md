### Abstract

This chapter describes numerical methods for estimating the fundamental matrix given a set of point correspondences between two images and covers a method image rectification based on the computed $$F$$.

### 11.1 Basic equations

1. From the equation $$x^{\prime T}Fx = 0 \quad \quad (11.1)$$, we can obtain a set of linear equations of the form $$Af = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1^\prime x_1 & x_1^\prime y_1 & x_1^\prime & y_1^\prime x_1 & y_1^\prime y_1 & y_1^\prime & x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
x_n^\prime x_n & x_n^\prime y_n & x_n^\prime & y_n^\prime x_n & y_n^\prime y_n & y_n^\prime & x_n & y_n & 1
\end{bmatrix} f = 0 \quad \quad (11.3)$$, where f is the 9-vector made up of the entries of $$F$$ in row-major order.

2. This is homogeneous set of equations, and $$f$$ can only be determined up to scale. For a solution to  exist, matrix $$A$$ must have rank at most 8. If the data is not exact, because of noise in the point coordinates, then the rank of $$A$$ may be greater than 8. In this case, one finds a least-squares solution.

#### 11.1 The singularity constraint

1. An important property of th fundamental matrix is that it is singular, in fact of rank 2. The matrix $$F$$ found by solving the set of linear equations (11.3) will not in general have rank 2, and we should take steps to enforce this constraint. The most convenient way to do this is to correct the matrix $$F$$ found by the SVD solution from $$A$$.

3. The 8-point algorithm for computation of the fundamental matrix: 1) __Linear solution.__ A solution $$F$$ is obtained from the vector $$f$$ corresponding to the smalles singular value of $$A$$, where $$A$$ is defined in (11.3). 2) __Constraint enforcement.__ Replace $$F$$ by $$F^\prime$$, the closest singular matrix to $$F$$ under a Frobenius norm. This correction is done using the SVD.

#### 11.1.2 The minimum case - seven point correspondences

### 11.2 The normalized 8-point algorithm

1. The key to success with the 8-point algorithm is proper careful normalization of the input data before constructing the equations to solve. The suggested normalization is a translation and scaling of each image so that the centroid of the reference points is at the origin of the coordinates and the RMS distance of the points from the origin is equal to $$\sqrt{2}$$. This is carried out for essentially the same reasons as in chapter 4.

### 11.3 The algebraic minimization algorithm

1. Numerically, the normalized 8-point algorithm is not optimal, since all the entries of $$F$$ do not have equal importance, and indeed some entries are more tightly constrained by the point-correspondence data than others.

2. An alternative procedure to compute the fundamental matrix is to find the desired singular matrix $$F^\prime$$ directly. Thus, just as $$F$$ is computed by minimizing the norm $$\left \| Af \right \|$$ subject to $$\left \| f \right \|=1$$, so one should aim to find the _singular_ matrix $$F^\prime$$ that minimizes $$\left \| Af^\prime \right \|$$ subject to $$\left \| f^\prime \right \|=1$$.

#### 11.3.1 Iterative estimation

2. Note the advantage of this method of computing $$F$$ is that the iterative part of the algorithm consists of a very small parameter minimization problem, involving the estimation of only three parameters (the homogeneous coordinates of $$e$$).

### 11.4 Geometric distance

1. This section describes three algorithms which minimize a geometric image distance.

2. The Gold Standard method requires the most effort in implementation. The other algorithms produce extremely good results and are easier to implement, but are not optimal under the assumption that the image errors are Gaussian.

3. Two important issues for each of the algorithms are the initialization for the non-linear minimization, and the parametrization of the cost function.

4. In all cases, we recommend that the image points be normalized by a translation and scaling.

#### 11.4.1 The Gold Standard method

1. The Maximum Likelihood estimate of the fundamental matrix depends on the assumption of an error model. We make the assumption that noise in image point measurements obey a Gaussian distribution. In that case, the ML estimate is the one that minimizes the geometric distance (which is reprojection error) $$\sum_{i} d(x_i,\hat{x_i})^2 + d(x_i^\prime,\hat{x_i}^\prime)^2 \;\; \; \;   subject\;  to \;  \hat{x_i}^\prime = \hat{H}\hat{x_i}\quad \quad (11.6)$$.

#### 11.4.2 Parametrization of rank-2 matrices

1. The non-linear minimization of the geometric distance cost functions requires a parametrization of the fundamental matrix which enforces the rank 2-property of the matrix.

2. __Over-parametrization.__

3. __Epipolar parametrization.__

4. __Both epipoles as parameters.__

#### 11.4.3 First-order geometric error (Sampson distance)

1. The concept of Sampson distance was discussed at length in section 4.2.6.

2. This corst function gives a first-order approximation to geometric error, which may be expected to give good results if higher order terms are small in comparison to the first.

3. The key advantage of approximating the geometric error in this way is that the resulting cost function only involves the parameters of $$F$$.

### 11.5 Experimental evaluation of the algorithms

#### 11.5.1 Recommendations

1. Do not use the unnormaized 8-point algorithm.

2. For a quick method, easy to implement, use the normalized 8-point algorithm 11.1. This often gives adequate resutls, and is ideal as a first step in other algorithms.

3. If more accuracy is desired, use the algebraic minimization method, either with or without iteration on the position of the epipole.

4. As an alternative that gives excellenct results, use an iterative-minimization method that minimizes the Sampson cost function (11.9). This and the iterative algebraic method give similar results.

5. To be certain of getting the best results, if Gaussian noise is a viable assumption, implement the Gold Standard algorithm.
