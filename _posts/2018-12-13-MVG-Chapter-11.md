### Abstract

This chapter describes numerical methods for estimating the fundamental matrix given a set of point correspondences between two images and covers a method image rectification based on the computed $$F$$.

### 11.1 Basic equations

1. From the equation $$x^{\prime T}Fx = 0 \quad \quad (11.1)$$, we can obtain a set of linear equations of the form $$Af = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1^\prime x_1 & x_1^\prime y_1 & x_1^\prime & y_1^\prime x_1 & y_1^\prime y_1 & y_1^\prime & x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
. & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & .\\
x_n^\prime x_n & x_n^\prime y_n & x_n^\prime & y_n^\prime x_n & y_n^\prime y_n & y_n^\prime & x_n & y_n & 1
\end{bmatrix} f = 0 \quad \quad (11.3)$$, where $$f$$ is the 9-vector made up of the entries of $$F$$ in row-major order.

2. This is homogeneous set of equations, and $$f$$ can only be determined up to scale. For a solution to  exist, matrix $$A$$ must have rank at most 8. If the data is not exact, because of noise in the point coordinates, then the rank of $$A$$ may be greater than 8. In this case, one finds a least-squares solution.

#### 11.1 The singularity constraint

1. An important property of th fundamental matrix is that it is singular, in fact of rank 2. The matrix $$F$$ found by solving the set of linear equations (11.3) will not in general have rank 2, and we should take steps to enforce this constraint. The most convenient way to do this is to correct the matrix $$F$$ found by the SVD solution from $$A$$.

3. The 8-point algorithm for computation of the fundamental matrix: 1) __Linear solution.__ A solution $$F$$ is obtained from the vector $$f$$ corresponding to the smalles singular value of $$A$$, where $$A$$ is defined in (11.3). 2) __Constraint enforcement.__ Replace $$F$$ by $$F^\prime$$, the closest singular matrix to $$F$$ under a Frobenius norm. This correction is done using the SVD.

#### 11.1.2 The minimum case - seven point correspondences

### 11.2 The normalized 8-point algorithm

1. The key to success with the 8-point algorithm is proper careful normalization of the input data before constructing the equations to solve. The suggested normalization is a translation and scaling of each image so that the centroid of the reference points is at the origin of the coordinates and the RMS distance of the points from the origin is equal to $$\sqrt{2}$$. This is carried out for essentially the same reasons as in chapter 4.

### 11.3 The algebraic minimization algorithm

1. Numerically, the normalized 8-point algorithm is not optimal, since all the entries of $$F$$ do not have equal importance, and indeed some entries are more tightly constrained by the point-correspondence data than others.

2. An alternative procedure to compute the fundamental matrix is to find the desired singular matrix $$F^\prime$$ directly. Thus, just as $$F$$ is computed by minimizing the norm $$\left \| Af \right \|$$ subject to $$\left \| f \right \|=1$$, so one should aim to find the _singular_ matrix $$F^\prime$$ that minimizes $$\left \| Af^\prime \right \|$$ subject to $$\left \| f^\prime \right \|=1$$.

#### 11.3.1 Iterative estimation

1. __Algorithm 11.2.__ Computation of $$F$$ with $$det\;F = 0$$ by iteratively minimizing algebraic error.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TongLing916/tongling916.github.io/master/img/post-minimizing-algebraic-error-for-F.JPG)

2. Note the advantage of this method of computing $$F$$ is that the iterative part of the algorithm consists of a very small parameter minimization problem, involving the estimation of only three parameters (the homogeneous coordinates of $$e$$).

### 11.4 Geometric distance

1. This section describes three algorithms which minimize a geometric image distance.

2. The Gold Standard method requires the most effort in implementation. The other algorithms produce extremely good results and are easier to implement, but are not optimal under the assumption that the image errors are Gaussian.

3. Two important issues for each of the algorithms are the initialization for the non-linear minimization, and the parametrization of the cost function.

4. In all cases, we recommend that the image points be normalized by a translation and scaling.

#### 11.4.1 The Gold Standard method

1. The Maximum Likelihood estimate of the fundamental matrix depends on the assumption of an error model. We make the assumption that noise in image point measurements obey a Gaussian distribution. In that case, the ML estimate is the one that minimizes the geometric distance (which is reprojection error) $$\sum_{i} d(x_i,\hat{x_i})^2 + d(x_i^\prime,\hat{x_i}^\prime)^2 \;\; \; \;   subject\;  to \;  \hat{x_i}^\prime = \hat{H}\hat{x_i}\quad \quad (11.6)$$.

#### 11.4.2 Parametrization of rank-2 matrices

1. The non-linear minimization of the geometric distance cost functions requires a parametrization of the fundamental matrix which enforces the rank 2-property of the matrix.

2. __Over-parametrization.__

3. __Epipolar parametrization.__

4. __Both epipoles as parameters.__

#### 11.4.3 First-order geometric error (Sampson distance)

1. The concept of Sampson distance was discussed at length in section 4.2.6.

2. This corst function gives a first-order approximation to geometric error, which may be expected to give good results if higher order terms are small in comparison to the first.

3. The key advantage of approximating the geometric error in this way is that the resulting cost function only involves the parameters of $$F$$.

### 11.5 Experimental evaluation of the algorithms

#### 11.5.1 Recommendations

1. Do not use the unnormaized 8-point algorithm.

2. For a quick method, easy to implement, use the normalized 8-point algorithm 11.1. This often gives adequate resutls, and is ideal as a first step in other algorithms.

3. If more accuracy is desired, use the algebraic minimization method, either with or without iteration on the position of the epipole.

4. As an alternative that gives excellenct results, use an iterative-minimization method that minimizes the Sampson cost function (11.9). This and the iterative algebraic method give similar results.

5. To be certain of getting the best results, if Gaussian noise is a viable assumption, implement the Gold Standard algorithm.

### 11.6 Automatic computation of $$F$$

1. This section describes an algorithm to compute the epipolar geometry between two images automatically. The input to the algorithm is simply the pair of images, with no other _a priori_ information required; and the output is the estimated fundamental matrix together with a set of interest points in correspondence.

2. The algorithm uses RANSAC as a search engine in a similar manner to its use in the automatic computation of a homography described in [section 4.8][mvg-automatic-computation-homography].

3. __Algorithm 11.4.__ Algorithm to automatically estimate the fundamental matrix between two images using RANSAC.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TongLing916/tongling916.github.io/master/img/post-ransac-for-F.JPG)

4. __The RANSAC sample.__ Only 7 point correspondences are used to estimate $$F$$.

5. __The distance measure.__ Given a current estimate of $$F$$ (from the RANSAC sample), the distance $$d_\perp$$ measures how closely a matched pair of points satisfies the epipolar geometry. There are two choices for $$d_\perp$$: 1) reprojection error, 2) the Sampson approximation to reprojection error.

6. __Guided matching.__ The current estimate of $$F$$ defines a search band in the second image around the epipolar line $$Fx$$ of $$x$$.

7. __Implementation and run details.__

### 11.7 Special cases of $$F$$-computation

1. In each case, the number of DOF of the fundamental matrix is less than the 7 of general motion.

#### 11.7.1 Pure translational motion

1. In this case (see section 9.3.1), the fundamental matrix has two DOF and can be computed uniquely from two point correspondences.

2. In the general motion case if all 3D points are coplanar, which is a structure degeneracy, the fundamental matrix cannot be determined uniquely from image correspondences. However, for pure translational motion, this is not a problem (two 3D points are always coplanar). The only degeneracy is if the two 3D points are coplanar with both camera centres.

#### 11.7.2 Planar motion

1. In the case of planar motion, described in section 9.3.2, we require that the symmetric part of $$F$$ has rank 2, in addition to the standard rank 2 condition for the full matrix.

#### 11.7.3 The calibrated case

1. In the case of calibrated cameras, normalized image coordinates may be used, and the essential matrix $$E$$ computed instead of the fundamental matrix.

2. Where the method differs from the computation of the fundamental matrix is in the enforcement of the constraints.

### 11.8 Correspondence of other entities

1. __Lines.__ The correspondence of image lines between views places _no_ constraint at all on $$F$$. In the case of parallel lines, the correspondence of vanishing points does provide a constraint on $$F$$. However, a vanishing point has the same status as any finite point, i.e. it provides one constraint.

2. __Space curves and surfaces.__ If an epipolar line is tangent to an imaged curve in one view, then the corresponding epipolar line must be tangent to the imaged curve in the other view. Similary, in the case of surfaces, at points at which the epipolar plane is tangent to the surface, the images outline is tangent to the corresponding epipolar lines.

### 11.9 Degeneracies

#### 11.9.1 Points on a ruled quadric

1. Degeneracy occurs if both camera centres and all the 3D points lie on a (ruled) quadric surface referred to as the the _critical surface_.

#### 11.9.2 Points on a plane

1. An important degeneracy is when all the points lie in a plane. In this case, all the points plus the two camera lie on ruled quadric surface, namely the degenerate quadric consisting of two planes - the plane through the points, plus a plane passing through the two camera centres.

#### 11.9.3 No translation

1. If the two camera centres are coincident, then the epipolar geometry is not defined. In this case, the two images are related by a 2D homography.

### 11.10 A geometric interpretation of $$F$$-computation

1. The estimation of $$F$$ from a set of image correspondences has many similarities with the problem of estimating a conic from a set of 2D points (or a quadric from a set of 3D points).

### 11.11 The envelope of epipolar lines

1. One of the uses of the fundamental matrix is to determine epipolar lines in a second image corresponding to points in a first image. In general, instead of searching along the epipolar line only, it will be necessary to search in a region on either side of the line $$Fx$$. We will now consider how the covariance matrix of the fundamental matrix may be used to determine the region in which to search.

#### 11.11.1 Verification of epipolar line covariance

1. In the case where the points to be matched are close to the epipole, then the determination of the epipolar line is more unstable, since any uncertainty in the position of the epipole results in uncertainty in the slope of the epipolar line.

### 11.12 Image rectification

1. This section gives a method for image rectification, the process of resampling pairs stereo images taken from widely differing viewpoints in order to produce a pair of "matched epipolar projection". These are projections in which the epipolar lines run parallel with the $$x$$-axis and match up between views, and consequently disparities between the images are in the $$x$$-direction only, i.e., there is no $$y$$-disparity.

2. The method is based on the fundamental matrix. A pair of 2D projective transformations are applied to the two images in oder to match the epipolar lines.

3. Since the application of arbitrary 2D projective transformations may distort the image substantially, the method for find the pair of transformations subjects the images to a minimal distortion.

4. In effect, transforming the two images by the appropriate projective transformations reduces the problem to the epipolar geometry produced by a pair of identical cameras places side by side with their principal axes parallel.

5. After this rectification, the search for matching points is vastly simplified by the simple epipolar structure and by the near-correspondence of the two images. It may be used as a preliminary step to comprehensive image matching.  

#### 11.12.1 Mapping the epipole to infinity

1. In fact, if epipolar lines are to be transformed to lines parallel with the $$x$$-axis, then the epipole should be mapped to the particular infinite point $$(1,0,0)^T$$. In order that the resampled image should look somewhat like the original image, we may put closer restrictions on the choice of $$H$$.

2. One condition that leads to good results is to insist that the transformation $$H$$ should act as far as possible as a rigid transformation in the neighbourhood of a given selected point $$x_0$$ of the image.

#### 11.12.2 Matching transformations

1. It will be seen how a map may be applied to the other image to match up the epipolar lines.

2. The intention is to resample these two images according to transformations $$H$$ to be applied to $$J$$ and $$H^\prime$$ to be applied to $$J^\prime$$.

3. One strategy in choosing a matched pair of transformations is to choose $$H^\prime$$ first to be some transformation that sends the epipole $$e^\prime$$ to infinity. We then seek a matching transformation $$H$$ chosen so as to minimize the sum-of-squared distances $$\sum_{i} d(Hx_i, H^\prime x^\prime_i)^2$$.

#### 11.12.3 Algorithm outline

1. The input is a pair of images containing a common overlap region. The ouput is a pair of images resampled so that the epipolar lines in the two images are horizontal (parallel with the $$x$$-axis), and such that corresponding points in the two images are as close to each other as possible.

2. A top-level outline of the algorithm is as follows: <br>
  1) Identify a seed set of image-to-image matches $$x_i \leftrightarrow x_i^\prime$$ between the two images. Seven points at least are needed, though more are preferable. It is possible to find such matches by automatic means. <br>
  2) Compute the fundamental matrix $$F$$ and find the epipoles $$e$$ and $$e^\prime$$ in the two images. <br>
  3) Select a projective transformation $$H^\prime$$ that maps the epipole $$e^\prime$$ to the point at infinity, $$(1,0,0)^T$$.<br>
  4) Find the matching projective transformation $$H$$ that minimizes the least-squares distance $$\sum_{i} d(Hx_i, H^\prime x^\prime_i)^2$$.
  5) Resample the first image according to the projective transformation $$H$$ and the second image according to the projective transformation $$H^\prime$$.

#### 11.12.4 Affine rectification

1. If the two cameras can be well approximated by affine cameras, then one can rectify the images using just affine transformations.
