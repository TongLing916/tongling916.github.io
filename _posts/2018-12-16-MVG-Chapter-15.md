### Abstract

The trifocal tensor plays an analogous role in three views to that played by the fundamental matrix in two. It is independent of scene structure depending only on the (projective) relations between the cameras.

### 15.1 The geometric basis for the trifocal tensor

1. __Degrees of freedom.__ The trifocal tensor consists of three $$3 \times 3$$ matrices, and thus has 27 elements. The tensor has only 18 independent degrees of freedom.

#### 15.1.1 Homographies induced by a plane

1. The homography from the first to the third image induced by a line $$l^\prime$$ in the second image is given by $$x^{\prime \prime} = H_{13}(l^\prime)x$$, where $$H_{13}(l^\prime) = \left [ T_1^T,T_2^T,T_3^T \right ]l^\prime$$.

#### 15.1.2 Point and line incidence relations

#### 15.1.3 Epipolar lines

#### 15.1.4 Extracting the fundamental matrices

#### 15.1.5 Retrieving the camera matrices

1. The trifocal tensor may be computed from the three camera matrices, and that conversely the three camera matrices may be computed, up to projective equivalence, from the trifocal tensor.

2. __Algorithm 15.1.__ Summary of $$F$$ and $$P$$ retrieval from the trifocal tensor. Note, $$F_21$$ and $$F_31$$ are determined uniquely. However, $$P^\prime$$ and $$P^{\prime \prime}$$ are determined only up to a common projective transformation of 3-space.

### 15.2 The trifocal tensor and tensor notation

#### 15.2.1 The trilinearities

### 15.3 Transfer

1. Given three views of a scene and a pair of matched points in two views, one may wish to determine the position of the point in the third view.

#### 15.3.1 Point transfer using fundamental matrices

1. Taking the intersection of the epipolar lines gives $$x^{\prime \prime} = (F_{31}x) \times (F_{32}x^\prime)$$. This method of point transfer using the fundamental matrices will be called _epipolar transfer_.

2. Epipolar transfer fails when the two epipolar lines in the third image are coincident (and becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as the lines become less "transverse"). In this case, $$X$$ lies on the _trifocal_ plane defined by the three camera centres. Epipolar transfer will fail for points $$X$$ lying on the trifocal plane and will inaccurate for points lying near that plane. Note, in the special case that the three camera centres are collinear, the trifocal plane is not uniquely defined, and epipolar transfer fails for all points.

#### 15.3.2 Point transfer using the trifocal tensor

1. A measured correspondence $$x\leftrightarrow x^\prime$$ is transferred by the following steps:
  1. Compute $$F_{21}$$ from the trifocal tensor (by the method given in algorithm 15.1), and correct $$x\leftrightarrow x^\prime$$ to the exact correspondence $$\hat{x}\leftrightarrow \hat{x}^\prime$$ using algorithm 12.1.
  2. Compute the line $$l^\prime$$ through $$\hat{x}^\prime$$ and perpendicular to $$l_e^\prime=F_{21}\hat{x}$$. If $$l_e^\prime=(l_1,l_2,l_3)^T$$ and $$\hat{x}^\prime=(\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}_2,1)^T$$, then $$l^\prime=(l_2,-l_1,-\hat{x}_1l_2+\hat{x}_2l_1)^T$$.
  3. The transferred point is $$x^{\prime \prime k}=\hat{x}^{i}l_j^\prime \mathcal{T}_i^{jk}$$.

2. __Degenerate configurations.__ The 3D point $$X$$ is only undefined if it lies on the baseline joining the first and second camera centres. However, there is no problem transferring a point lying on the baseline between views two and three, or anywhere else on the trifocal plane. This is the key difference between epipolar transfer and transfer using the trifocal tensor. The former is undefined for _any_ point on the trifocal plane.

#### 15.3.3 Line transfer using the trifocal tensor

#### 15.4 The fundamental matrices for three views

1. The three fundamental matrices $$F_{21},F_{31},F_{32}$$ are not independent, but satisfy three relations: $$e_{23}^TF_{21}e_{13}=e_{31}^TF_{32}e_{21}=e_{32}^TF_{31}e_{12}=0 \quad \quad (15.11)$$.

#### 15.4.1 Uniqueness of camera matrices given three fundamental matrices

1. __Result 15.7.__ Given three compatible fundamental matrices $$F_{21},F{31}$$ and $$F_{32}$$ satisfying the non-collinearity condition, the three corresponding camera matrices $$P, P^\prime$$ and $$P^{\prime \prime}$$ are unique up to the choice of a 3D projective coordinate frame.

#### 15.4.2 Computation of camera matrices from three fundamental matrices

1. The trifocal tensor is preferable to a triple to compatible fundamental matrices as a means of determining the geometry of three views. This is because the difficulty with the views being collinear is not an issue with the trifocal tensor. It is well defined and uniquely determines the geometry even for collinear cameras. The difference is that the fundamental matrices do not contain a direct constraint on the relative displacements between the three cameras, whereas this is built into the trifocal tensor.

#### 15.4.3 Camera matrices compatible with two fundamental matrices

1. Suppose we are given only two fundamental matrices $$F_{21}$$ and $$F_{31}$$. To what extent do these fix the geometry of the three cameras_ it will be shown that there are four degrees of freedom in the solution for the camera matrices, beyond the usual projective ambiguity. 

### 15.5 Closure
