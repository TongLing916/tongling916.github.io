### Abstract

The trifocal tensor plays an analogous role in three views to that played by the fundamental matrix in two. It is independent of scene structure depending only on the (projective) relations between the cameras.

### 15.1 The geometric basis for the trifocal tensor

1. __Degrees of freedom.__ The trifocal tensor consists of three $$3 \times 3$$ matrices, and thus has 27 elements. The tensor has only 18 independent degrees of freedom.

#### 15.1.1 Homographies induced by a plane

1. The homography from the first to the third image induced by a line $$l^\prime$$ in the second image is given by $$x^{\prime \prime} = H_{13}(l^\prime)x$$, where $$H_{13}(l^\prime) = \left [ T_1^T,T_2^T,T_3^T \right ]l^\prime$$.

#### 15.1.2 Point and line incidence relations

#### 15.1.3 Epipolar lines

#### 15.1.4 Extracting the fundamental matrices

#### 15.1.5 Retrieving the camera matrices

1. The trifocal tensor may be computed from the three camera matrices, and that conversely the three camera matrices may be computed, up to projective equivalence, from the trifocal tensor.

2. __Algorithm 15.1.__ Summary of $$F$$ and $$P$$ retrieval from the trifocal tensor. Note, $$F_21$$ and $$F_31$$ are determined uniquely. However, $$P^\prime$$ and $$P^{\prime \prime}$$ are determined only up to a common projective transformation of 3-space.
