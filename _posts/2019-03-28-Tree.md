### 真题

1. [树的遍历](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/TreeTraversals.html)
  - preorder:
    In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive preorder traversal of the right subtree.
  - inorder:
    In an inorder traversal, we recursively do an inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the root node, and finally do a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree.
  - postorder: 
    In a postorder traversal, we recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree followed by a visit to the root node.
