### [15. 3 Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

#### Question

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers, are there elements a, b, c in `nums` such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

__Note:__

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

__Example 1:__
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

#### Train of Thought

To avoid duplicate triplets, we need to sort the numbers at first and then traverse from the start to the end. After fixing the first number, we can choose the number after the first as the second one and the last number as the third one. Then, test if their sum is 0. If smaller, then use a bigger number as the second one. If larger, use a smaller one as the third one.

Note that we can skip those numbers which are equal to the chosen ones for a quicker computation.

#### Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

class Solution {
public:
	vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
		vector<vector<int>> res;

		int n = nums.size();
		if (n <= 2)
			return res;

		std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

		for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i)
		{
			if (nums[i] > 0)
				break;
			if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])
				continue;

			int j = i + 1;
			int k = n - 1;
			while (j < k)
			{
				if (nums[i] + nums[j] == -nums[k])
				{
					res.push_back({ nums[i], nums[j], nums[k] });
					while (j < k && nums[j + 1] == nums[j])
						++j;
					++j;
					while (j < k && nums[k - 1] == nums[k])
						--k;
					--k;
				}
				else if (nums[i] + nums[j] < -nums[k])
					++j;
				else
					--k;
			}
		}

		return res;
	}
};

int main()
{
	vector<int> test1{ -1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4 };

	Solution solution;
	vector<vector<int>> res = solution.threeSum(test1);
	for (auto r : res)
	{
		for (auto e : r)
			cout << e << " ";
		cout << endl;
	}
}

```

### [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

#### Question

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

#### Train of Thought

The aim is to find the maximum subarray. Therefore, it is necessary to create a variable named `maxValue`, which should be compared with different subarrays.

The difficulty is how to traverse all the subarrays. A naive thought is brute force. However, is it possible to traverse in `O(n)` time? Every time when we access an element e.g. `nums[i]`, we just need compare the `maxValue` with the biggest subarray which ends at `nums[i]`. Then, after we have scanned the whole vector, we have already done with the finding process.

To get the biggest subarray which ends at `nums[i]`, we just need to compare `nums[i]` with (`nums[i]` + the biggest subarray ending at `nums[i-1]`).

#### Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
	int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
		int n = nums.size();
		if (n == 0)
			return 0;
		int maxValue = nums[0];
		int cur = nums[0];

		for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
		{
			cur = max(nums[i], cur + nums[i]);
			maxValue = max(maxValue, cur);
		}
		return maxValue;
	}
};
int main()
{
	Solution solution;
	vector<int> nums{ -2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4 };

	cout << solution.maxSubArray(nums) << endl;
}
```

### [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

#### Question

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears __more than__ `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

#### Train of Thought

[Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm): In its simplest form, the algorithm finds a majority element, if there is one: that is, an element that occurs repeatedly for more than half of the elements of the input. However, if there is no majority, the algorithm will not detect that fact, and will still output one of the elements. A version of the algorithm that makes a second pass through the data can be used to verify that the element found in the first pass really is a majority.

Another [explanation](https://gregable.com/2013/10/majority-vote-algorithm-find-majority.html).

#### Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
	int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums)
	{
		int n = nums.size();
		int major = 0, count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
		{
			if (!count)
			{
				major = nums[i];
				++count;
			}
			else
			{
				if (major == nums[i])
					++count;
				else
					--count;
			}
		}
		return major;
	}
};
int main()
{
	Solution solution;
	vector<int> nums{ 2,2,1,1,1,2,2 };

	cout << solution.majorityElement(nums) << endl;
}
```

### [229. Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/)

#### Question

Given an integer array of size _n_, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

Note: The algorithm should run in __linear__ time and in `O(1)` space.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

#### Train of Thought

It's also a Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm. However, last time, we need to find an element which appears __more than__ `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times, so only one element at most can exist. We can then create one variable and its count to traverse the whole array.

This time, we need to find elements which appears __more than__ `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times. Then, how many elements at most can we find? It's __2__. That means, we need two `major`s and two their `count`s to save the possible majority elements. Unlike the last question, we need now to validate these candidates so that to find out if we have only one majority element or two.

Another important thing to say is that we could initialize these `major`s with different values, and then start to traverse the whole array.

#### Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
static int desyncio = []() {
	std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(nullptr);
	cout.tie(nullptr);
	return 0;
}();
class Solution {
public:
	vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums)
	{
		int n = nums.size();
		if (n <= 1)
			return nums;
		int major1 = 0, major2 = 1;
		int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

		for (auto& num : nums)
		{
			if (major1 == num)
				++count1;
			else if (major2 == num)
				++count2;
			else if (!count1)
			{
				major1 = num;
				count1 = 1;
			}
			else if (!count2)
			{
				major2 = num;
				count2 = 1;
			}
			else
			{
				--count1;
				--count2;
			}
		}

		vector<int> res;
		count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
		for (auto& num : nums)
		{
			if (num == major1)
				++count1;
			else if (num == major2)
				++count2;
		}
		if (count1 > n / 3)
			res.push_back(major1);
		if (count2 > n / 3)
			res.push_back(major2);

		return res;
	}
};
int main()
{
	Solution solution;
	vector<int> nums{ 1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2 };
	vector<int> nums2{ 3,2,3 };
	vector<int> nums3{ 1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6 };
	vector<int> nums4{ 1,2,1,1,1,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4 };
	vector<int> nums5{ 1,2,2,3,2,1,1,3 };
	vector<int> res = solution.majorityElement(nums5);
	for (auto r : res)
		cout << r << endl;
}
```
