## 2.1 Planar geometry
1. What is _Tensor_? 

2. A significant advantage of the algebraic approach to geometry is that results derived in this way may more easily be used to derive algorithms and practical computational methods.

## 2.2 The 2D projective plane
### 2.2.1 Points and lines

3. __Homogeneous representation of lines.__ $$ ax + by + c = 0 $$ and $$ (ka)x + (kb)y + (kc) = 0 $$ are the same, for any non-zero constant $$k$$. Thus, the vectors $$ (a, b, c)^\intercal $$ and $$ k(a, b, c)^\intercal $$ represent the same line, for any non-zero $$k$$.

4. __Homogeneous representation of points.__ $$ (x,y,1)^\intercal $$.

5. __Result 2.1.__ _The points $$ x $$ lies on the line $$ l $$ if and only if $$ x^\intercal l = 0 $$.

6. __Degrees of freedom (dof).__ A line is specified by two parameters (the two independent ratios $$ \big\{a : b : c\big\} $$) and so has two degrees of freedom.

7. __Result 2.2.__ _The intersection of two lines $$ l $$ and $$ l^\prime $$ is the point $$ x =  l \times {l^\prime} $$._

8. __Result 2.4.__ _The line through two points $$ x $$ and $$ x^\prime $$ is the point $$ l =  x \times x^\prime $$._

### 2.2.2 Ideal points and the line at infinity

9. __Intersection of parallel lines.__ E.g. $$ ax+by+c = 0 $$ and $$ ax+by+c^\prime = 0 $$, represented by vectors $$ l = (a,b,c)^\intercal $$ and $$ l^\prime = (a,b,c^\prime)^\intercal $$. The intersection is $$ l \times l^\prime = (c^\prime - c)(b,-a,0)^\intercal $$, and igoring the scale factor $$ (c^\prime - c) $$, this is the point $$ (b,-a,0)^\intercal $$.

10. __Ideal points and the line at infinity.__ Homogeneous vectors $$ x = (x_1,x_2,x_3)^\intercal $$ such that $$ x_3 \neq 0 $$ correspond to finite points in $$ \mathbb{R^2} $$. One may augment $$ \mathbb{R^2} $$ by adding points with last coordinate $$x_3 = 0$$. The resulting space is the set of all homogeneous 3-vectors, namely the projective space $$ \mathbb{P^2} $$. The points with last coordinate $$ x_3 = 0 $$ are known as _ideal_ points, or points at infinity. The set of all ideal points may be written $$ (x_1,x_2,0)^\intercal $$, with a particular point specified by the ratio $$x_1:x_2$$. Note this set lies on a single line, the _line of infinity_, denoted by the vector $$l_\infty = (0,0,1)^\intercal$$. The line at inifinity can be also thought of as the set of directions of lines in the plane.

11. __A model for the projective plane.__ A fruitful way of thinking of $$ \mathbb{P^2} $$ is as a set of rays in $$ \mathbb{R^3} $$. <br>

12. __Reuslt 2.6. Duality principle.__ _To any theorem of 2-dimensional projective geometry there corresponds a dual theorem, which may be derived by interchanging the roles of points and lines in the original theorem._ Example: Result 2.2 and 2.4.

### 2.2.3 Conics and dual conics

13. The euqation of a conic in inhomogeneous coordinate is
$$
ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0
$$ 
<br> i.e. a polynomial of degree 2. "Homogenizing" this by the replacements: $$ x \mapsto x_1/x_3, y \mapsto x_2/x_3 $$ gives
$$
a{x_1}^2 + b{x_1}{x_2} + c{x_2}^2 + d{x_1}{x_3} + e{x_2}{x_3} + f{x_3}^2 = 0 \quad (2.1) 
$$
<br> or in matrix form <br>
$$
x^\intercal C x = 0 \quad (2.2) 
$$
<br>where the conic coefficient matrix $$C$$ is given by <br>
$$
C = \begin{bmatrix} a & b/2 & d/2 \\ b/2 & c & e/2 \\ d/2 & e/2 & f \end{bmatrix} \quad (2.3) 
$$
<br> Note that the conic coefficient matrix is symmetric. C is a homogeneous representation of a conic. The conic has five degrees of freedom which can be thought of as the ratios $$ \big\{a : b : c : d ï¼š e : f\big\} $$ or equivalently the six elemnts of a symmetric matrix less one for scale.

14. __Five points define a conic.__ Stacking the constraints from five points we obtain, where $$c=(a,b,c,d,e,f)^\intercal$$<br>
$$
\begin{bmatrix} {x_1}^2 & x_1 y_1 & {y_1}^2 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ {x_2}^2 & x_2 y_2 & {y_2}^2 & x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ {x_3}^2 & x_3 y_3 & {y_3}^2 & x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\ {x_4}^2 & x_4 y_4 & {y_4}^2 & x_4 & y_4 & 1 \\ {x_5}^2 & x_5 y_5 & {y_5}^2 & x_5 & y_5 & 1\end{bmatrix} c = 0 \quad (2.4) 
$$

15. __Result 2.7__ _The line $$ l $$ tangent to $$ C $$ at a point $$ x $$ on $$ C $$ is given by $$ l = Cx $$._

16. __Dual conics.__ The conic $$C$$ defined above is more properly termed a _point_ conic, as it defines an equation on points. Given the duality result 2.6 of $$\mathbb{P^2} $$ it is not surprising that there is also a conic which defines an equation on lines. This _dual_ (or line) conic is also represented by a $$3 \times 3$$ matrix, which we denote as $$C^*$$. A line $$l$$ _tangent_ to the conic $$C$$ satisfies $$l^\intercal C^* l = 0$$. The notation $$C^*$$ indicates that $$C^*$$ is the adjoint matrix of $$C$$. For a non-singular symmetric matrix $$C^*=C^{-1}$$.
<br>Note: The equation for a dual conic is straightforward to derive in the case that $$C$$ has full rank.

*Fig. Dual conics are also known as conic envelopes.*

17. __Degenerate conics.__ If the matrix $$C$$ is not of full rank, then the conic is termed degenerate. Degenerate point conics include two lines (rank 2), and a repeated line (rank 1). E.g. $$C = l m^\intercal + m l^\intercal$$.
	
## 2.3 Projective transformations

18. __Defition 2.9.__ A _projectivity_ is an invertible mapping _h_ from $$ \mathbb{ P^2 } $$ to itself such that three points $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$ and $$x_3$$ lie on the same line if and only if $$h(x_1), h(x_2), h(x_3)$$do.
<br> Projectivities form a group since the inverse of a projectivity is also a projectivity, and so is the composition of two projectivities. A projectivity is also called a _collineation_, a _projective transformation_ or a _homography_.

19. __Theorem 2.10.__ _A mapping h : $$ \mathbb{ P^2 } \rightarrow \mathbb{ P^2 } $$ is a projectivity if and only if there exists a non-singular 3 $$ \times $$ 3 matrix $$ \mathbf{H} $$ such that for any point in $$ \mathbb{ P^2 } $$ represented by a vector $$x$$ it is true that $$ h(x) = Hx $$_.
<br> To interpret this theorem, any point in $$\mathbb{P^2}$$ is represented as a homogeneous 3-vector. $$x$$, and $$Hx$$ is a linear mapping of homogeneous coordinates.

20. __Definition 2.11. Projective transformation.__ A planar projective transformation is a linear transformation on homogeneous 3-vectors represented by a non-singular $$3 \times 3$$ matrix:<br>
$$
\begin{pmatrix} x^\prime_1 \\ x^\prime_2 \\ x^\prime_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} \\ h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} \\ h_{31} & h_{32} & h_{33} \end{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{pmatrix} \quad (2.5) 
$$
<br>or more briefly, $$x^\prime = Hx$$
